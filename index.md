# About me 

* * *

 My name is Amanda and I am a Brazilian girl that recently (2016) started to study software development.
 Currently, I am a student of information system at Federal Institute of Goiás.

 However, I also am a biologist and I have a master degree in ecology and evolution. Some people think that biology is totally unrelated to technology. I don't think so.
 I believe that technology is related to everything, so biology is. 

 Since I started to study software development, my life is completely different. I still love biology and everything related to life and because of I really like to be involved with social programs and inclusion initiatives. I love to be involved with the community and I love to contribute to open source. I am also passionate about learning languages and another culture.
